publication_short: "Understanding Urgency in Radiology Reporting"

abstract: "In this study, we aim to develop an automatic pipeline to identify clinical findings in the unstructured text of radiology reports that necessitate communications between radiologists and referring physicians. Our approach identified 20 distinct clinical concepts and highlighted statistically significant concepts with strong associations to cases that require prompt communication."
